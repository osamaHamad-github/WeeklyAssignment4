      <p class="page-text">Linus Torvalds is a Finnish-American software engineer born on December 28, 1969, in Helsinki, Finland. His parents are Nils and Anna, both journalists. Linus’ interest in computers began when he was just 11 years old. He Started programming in the BASIC programming language using the Commodore VIC-20 home computer. He then purchased the Sinclair QL, which he excessively modified by creating his own text editor and code assembler, as well as writing several computer game clones. Linus attended the University of Helsinki in Finland, where he graduated with a master’s degree in computer science. Torvalds’ education was interrupted during his first year since he had to complete his mandatory military service in Finland and had to stay in the military for 11 months. Torvalds is now married to six-time karate champion, Tove Torvalds. He has three daughters, Daniela, Patricia and Celeste Torvalds. Linus Torvalds and his family moved to the United States and Torvalds officially became a U.S. citizen in 2010. Linus Torvalds is most famous for creating and partially developing the open-source operating system, Linux Kernel. Linux is one of the most popular platforms, with android being an example of an operating system powered by it. His other inventions include Git and Subsurface. Git is the most widely used version control system for computer programs, whether open source or closed source, big or small.</p>
