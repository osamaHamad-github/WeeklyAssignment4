Unlike most operating systems at the time, Linux was written in C rather than Assembly. Being that the Linux operating system is open source, you may download it for free, you may contribute in building the operating system and you may even customize the operating system to your liking once downloaded. Linux is the most widely used general purpose operating system because of the dominance of the Linux based Android OS, although it makes up only 2.3% of PC operating systems. Linux is usually downloaded by people as a Linux distribution (distro for short), which is an operating system based on the Linux Kernel along with other software such as libraries, documentation, window systems and desktop environments. Popular desktop distributions include Fedora, Debian and Ubuntu. The name “Linux” is a portmanteau of the words “Linus” and “Unix” to put emphasis on the fact that Linux is Unix-based.<br>

      <span class="invention-header"><br>Git-</span><br>
      <img class="invention-image" src="/images/git.jpg" alt="linux_image"><br>
      Git is the most widely used version control system for writing software. Git has become a global standard for software development, as it is a very useful and powerful tool for developers working on projects as a team. A version control system system allows developers to go to previous versions of their code and commit new changes. Git was initially developed to keep track to the changes that were made to Linux Kernel. In 2002, the Linux development community began using a VCS named BitKeeper. In 2005, BitKeeper’s developer company broke ties with the Linux community, which caused the community (in particular Linus Torvalds) to build their own VCS. What differentiates Git from other version control systems is that it is a Distributed Version Control System. This means that every developer working on a project will have the full history of all changes made to the program, rather than having only one place for the full history.<br>

      <span class="invention-header"><br>Subsurface-</span><br>
      <img class="invention-image" src="/images/subsurface.png" alt="subsurface_image"><br>
      In the early 2000’s, Linus Torvalds developed an interest in scuba diving, which eventually led him to creating the Subsurface project. Subsurface is a software which allows users to log and plan scuba dives. The program allows the diver to print a detailed log of information including water temperature, visibility, and pressure.<br></p>
